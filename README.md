# Certified-Associate-in-Data-Analytics 

This repo contains my solutions for the assignments and projects related to Python given in the training provided by TalentLabs under Khazanah Youth Development Programme (KYDP). The training modules include:

+ Data analysis with Python covering usage of Jupyter Notebook as well as handling data with Numpy and Pandas.
+ Data visualization with Python covering visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
+ Predictive analytics with Python covering the fundamental algorithms in machine learning for classification, regression and clustering with algorithms such as Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and K-Means.

#### Note:

#### In the Matplotlib and Seaborn exercise, some of the visuals are intentionally done to look horrible to showcase what would happen if we didnt properly evaluate and process the data before visualizing it
